I can definitely summarize the feedback for you. It's great that the community is so engaged and providing helpful notes! Here is a summary of the feedback and bug reports from the Reddit comments.

---

### Bugs and Technical Issues
* **Duplication Errors:** Several users reported that closing and reopening sections, such as the crew roster, Rigs section, or Apocalypse Program, caused content to be duplicated.
* **NaN Credits:** A specific bug was found where selecting Comet as a Gunner with a linked title would set credits to `NaN` (Not a Number).
* **Refunds:**
    * De-selecting Apocalypse E-War addons does not refund costs.
    * Closing a ship editor deselects subsystems without refunding.
    * Deselecting a hull without first un-selecting the options for it results in no refund.
* **Functionality Gaps:**
    * The Contracts section appears to be broken.
    * The Dragoon Raptor option does not add the expected +2 mobility rigs.
    * Hull discounts can exceed the 50% limit.
    * A player noted that they could not select T1 weapons (machine gun) for broadside or front mounts.
    * The game currently lacks a **save option**, which multiple users requested.

### Art and Design Feedback
* **AI Art:** The use of AI-generated images for ships and companions received significant negative feedback. Users described them as a "massive downgrade" from the original art, noting that they are "ugly" and don't fit the descriptions or personality of the characters/ships.
* **Visual Consistency:** The new art style was criticized for being inconsistent, with characters like Link or generic anime figures appearing in a sci-fi setting.
* **User Interface (UI):** On mobile and tablet devices, the visual feedback for selected items (like mobility rigs) is "borderline invisible," making it difficult to use.

### Gameplay and Quality of Life Suggestions
* **Missing Implementations:** Multiple users detailed missing or incomplete features:
    * Skills and Command Mods are missing their selection caps.
    * E-War and Spells are missing tier requirements.
    * Energy Subsystems are missing the option to buy multiples of the same item and shield discounts.
* **Ship Stats & Design:**
    * The stats for ships, particularly the Herald Medusa, are inconsistent with their class, making them either underpowered or overpowered.
    * Randomizing ship stats was advised against, as it can lead to unbalanced gameplay.
* **Quality of Life:**
    * Add a counter for items like courses, rigs, and mounts so players don't have to track them manually.
    * Fix the repetition of sections like Rigs and mana affinities.
* **Content Ideas:** Players had many creative ideas for new content, including:
    * A gadget selection category.
    * Pets and a marriage system with crew members.
    * An enemies and bounty page.
    * A system for upgrading and evolving the dragoon mount.
    * New high-tech AI crew.
* **Other Requests:** One user requested a "non-interactive" downloadable version to bypass the bugs, and another asked for a "god mod."
