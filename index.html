            a massive 100 square-kilometre hunk of metal orbiting a deadbeat planet. Pirate and Federation goons alike abide by the station's cease-fire rules, 
            and since this station is situated in quite literally the centre of civilized space, you can find all types of people here. You're here to start your 
            galactic quest (whatever that is), and to do that you will need a ship. You might even buy multiple, plus a ship crew, your ship's weapons... 
            you might need a calculator for this. Secretively, you pull up your holographic wallet and check to make sure that-yep, you can buy a ship.</p>

        <p>The venerable Federation Navy is the largest military space armada in the civilized galaxy. Consisting of many thousands of ships across many hundreds of branches, there is simply no force capable going toe-to-toe with them. Granted, with such a big sovereignty, the Navy is oftentimes spread thin, mobilizing as one only for extreme circumstances. Training to be a part of the Navy is extensive, thorough and disciplined, but it's known to reward many benefits... if sailing across the stars in some of the best tech around isn't enough, that is.</p>

        <p>Amidst the Federation's military might are its veritable spec ops programs, and there are many to choose from. Everything from solving internal strife to deploying in the outer-rim systems where piracy is large is inclusive; your stay won't be boring. However, your identity is often concealed, your social life often thrown out the window, and you won't really have many people to talk to other than your brothers and sisters of the forces. To some, that's worth it for a handful of the best skills in the galaxy</p>

        <p>Not from the military? No problem! Renowned Federation schools like Rosette University or the University of Arcadia don't offer pilot training without a reason, and that's just two of potentially thousands. Space- faring might be expensive to most people, but all it takes is a good set of skills and a healthy amount of credits to find yourself out of the atmos- phere. Many from the Federation venture out almost aimlessly, often finding themselves a part of different factions. In fact, that's how many of these factions were born.</p>

        <p>As a collective of many mercenary groups, the Blackhawk Elites are known as some of the most elite mercenaries out there. They spend most of their time out in the outer rims, providing protection to those out of the Federation's protective reach and need it. They come into contact with bandits and pirates alike often, but that's the life that the Black- hawks strive for. Their society is highly militaristic, focused on bleeding discipline into its members because that's the type of mindset they need.</p>

        <p>The Red Dagger Pirates are more of a coalition of several pirate groups spanning across the entirety of the civilized galaxy. While each group or gang more or less operate independently, they all generally have good standing with each other and can collaborate when needed. When it comes time for large scale conflict, they have a surprising ability to unite and mobilize almost as a make-shift military group fairly quickly. They've established a surprisingly efficient production line and have massive networks of shipyards across the outer rims.</p>

        <p>It has all come tumbling down for the Syndicate. A once large collective wealthy and powerful corporations, now crumbled and bombarded to dust by the recent Federation and Blackhawk galaxy-wide assault. Originally founded under the best of intentions while even establishing a big sovereignty and culture, corruption soon ran rampant, and the Syndi- cate found itself the centre of many shady trades. While not all of its members were inherently bad, all of its surviving corps and groups split, mainly between the feuding "Core" and "Outer" rings of organizations.</p>

        <p>Not much is known about the Talons to other factions, but they tend to operate within their own unknown purpose. Initially labeled as a pirate group by the Federation, the Talons are known to employ some of the greatest skilled individuals in the galaxy. They are known for their notori- ous reputation of a classy but skilled and intelligent touch. Unlike other 'pirate' groups, the Talons bolster technology that could rival the likes of the Blackhawks and Federation Spec Ops. A Talon appearance is rare and surprising, and often an indicator that something's going down.</p>

However, if you ever find yourself spelunking the depths of space in search of adventure and fortune on your lonesome, you'll also find yourself talking with others like yourself very often. Whether it's for the thrill of finding things never seen before or for the heaps of credits that ancient Herald artifacts can bring you, to others, it's all the same; you're a Dustkeeper. Maybe you travel alone, or maybe you travel with a band of like-minded people. Your purpose is seldom spoken, even if you get asked about it a lot.</p>

        to settle down in Valhalla. Even after the Pirate Coalition War where much Blackhawk territory

        very long time, long before they were first discovered by the Black- hawk Elite. Talon Prime is everything opposite of what you
        would expect of an outer-ring nation; it's clean, it's professional, and it's pleasant to live in. It's often said that the Talons have a sense of humour despite their professional appearance-they still, somehow, retain their outer-rim mentality and like to pick on those who take themselves too seriously.

          Daggers were surprised to find that they were offered it in return of having a trade deal with them. It seemed that the Talons had no interest in expanding territory, but the Red Daggers took it without hesitating, and has since become a very powerful asset and ally. Lastop is rich in the much-needed common ores, and the Talons and Red Daggers have taken advantage of it.

        <p>The Federation has plenty of virtues, but some groups have
        failed to see them within the galactic nation. The rising threats from pirate groups such as the Luos Syndicate caused uprising in the outer Federation systems; where was the Navy when they were most needed? Detritus was the second system to claim sepa- ratism from the Federation, having been long fed up with the incom- petency. And to make matters worse, the Federation simply dismissed the claim and labeled them as a "pirate group", along with the Exodus system. Being left they've to fend for themselves, held out against bandits and pirates using guerilla tactics and make-shift hardware.

        <p>Exodus, though not having been under as much threat from bandits as Detritus has, was the first to
          claim separatism from the Federa- tion. Having started out as a simple mining colony, resources were limited and were only ferried
          in small amounts from Wayward. Despite Exodus' calls for increased support, they went unanswered and began to establish the colony
          as their own, starting agricultural projects with what they had. Soon they became self-sustaining, but when support from the Federation finally cut off, they ended up not caring anymore.

        <p>Much of the once powerful Luos Syndicate now lies in ruin. Thou- sands of tons of twisted metal litter the entire Syndicate space from destroyed warships to unservicable space stations. Pirate and Federation activity is still rampant after the Syndicate's fall, and unrest is evident throughout the many remaining cities. Haven was the Syndicate capital, and it was also bombarded the most by the Federation and mercenary armada.
        Although Haven was largely considered the centre of the Core Ring corporations, it was bitter irony to them that the last vestiges of the Luos armada that defended the system were made up of their Outer Ring counterparts; groups that they didn't see eye-to-eye with. At this point in the war, most of the companies in the Syndicate forces were either routed or just deserted completely.

        <p>Several years after the Pirate Coalition War, the Blackhawk Elite and Federation fought back. With an armada spanning several thousand ships including nearly sixty dreadnoughts, the Navy-led assault took them to the three entry-systems of the Luos Syndi- cate: Olympus, Elysium and Solar- la. The Syndicate had prepared but despite their power, could not withstand their might. They held for a mere four days before being forced to retreat. Elysium saw the heaviest of the fights, but was also the last to fall.

        <p>Erebus was home to many of the Syndicate's Outer Ring corpora- tions, such as the industrious Reibar manufacturing company or the venerable Cerberus Legion. Living conditions here were a stark contrast to Haven; it was a much harsher environment stricken with a more rustic atmosphere. Strange enough, the people were friendlier, and it's likely that the inhabitants here were the original founders of the Syndicate who envisioned a prosperous nation. A mercenary coalition led by the Blackhawk Elites had planned a back-door attack from Valhalla and it was at Erebus where they entered the Syndicate. Unfortu- nately for them, however, they were met not by Syndicate forces but by Talons and Red Daggers in an ingenious ambush; almost half
        of the fleet was decimated by pre-aimed anti-matter cannon blasts as they landed in the system, predicted to the tee by Talon spies. The mercenary fleet was forced to flee, but so were the Talons and Red Daggers after they had heard that the Syndicate defence had failed up at the 'galactic north'. Rumors spread that both groups left due to other reasons, but neither elected to comment.

        <p>After the devastating Luos defeat at Olympus, Elysium and Solaria, the Federation forces tore through the remaining systems like a plague. Cities were bombarded to submission and Syndicate fleets were outnumbered and shredded apart by relentless firepower. The remaining Syndicate forces gathered at Abyss for a final defence led by Ise Ley'is, who was one of the only remaining Syndicate commanders that wasn't missing or had abandoned the Syndicate as a whole. Under valiant and ruthless leadership, she and the remaining Syndicate forces defended the system for two months before attrition burned them out. No ship was spared, and the few thousand surviving
        souls of an armada of nearly two million fled to Haven.

After the devastating Blackhawk losses at BR-5RB and DL7-2E, they were forced to aban- don Mjölnir, and a part of the pirate coalition took over the region. Ever since, they have almost always kept to themselves, despite the collaboration with the Luos Syndicate and the Red Dag- gers. They called themselves the Fire Legion. It was not until recently when they began raising hostilities with the Red Daggers and even the Blackhawk Elites, their
        skirmishes growing more and more violent. As of late, the Blackhawks have responded by setting up strong blockades across the region of space surrounding the Fire Legion. Meanwhile, the rest of the galaxy has resorted to watching with anxious curiosity. Rumors are spreading that this all has to do with the Heralds, but even more ominous rumors suggest about something called the Harbinger. Others say it has something to do with mana energy. Either way, those on the front lines claim that

            In order for a suit to wield mana effectively, it requires a mana catalyst. A single catalyst has the capability of executing up to 8 different spells, but also serves as a weapon for close-quarters combat since it may project a blade of raw mana that can be shaped with appropriate upgrades.
            All Apocalypse suits come with the base catalyst that can cast any tier 1 spell. It can be upgraded in a multitude of ways, and upgrades can focus on a specific subset of spell family or affinity. On the upgrade grid below, upgrades are tethered to their prerequisite upgrade. The prerequisite upgrade is signified by a glow at the tip of the tether, such as in example on the right.

            Spells have two components to them: the spell base and affinities. A spell base is the medium where the mana manifests itself into a physical form, such as an arrow or a wall. An affinity is a specific effect from the chosen spell family and tier.
            There are three different family of spell affinities: Paralogical, Elemental and Anticausal. Within each family are three different elements, and within each element are three tiers. You may apply any two affinities that you have unlocked to a spell base when casting the spell. However, a spell base cannot have more than one Tier 3 affinity applied at a time.

            <h3>Spells</h3>
            Combined spell bases may be executed in sequence or at the same time. If sequenced, the next spell base may execute where the previous spell base terminated. However, the maxi- mum range of the synthesized spell will only be as far as the longest-ranged spell base in the combination, and the cooldown is determiend by the slowest spell base.
            <h4>Spells have several stats:</h4>
            <ul style="text-align: left; columns: 2; column-gap: 20px;">
            <li>Potency: Determines the effectiveness of the given spell affinities to the base.</li>
            <li>Cooldown: The time it takes to cast the spell. Higher values means shorter times between casts.</li>
            <li>Range: The maximum optimal range that the spell base will travel.</li>
            <li>Velocity: The velocity of the spell projectile after being casted.</li>
            <li>Radius: The radius that the spell base physically encompasses.</li>
            <li>Uptime: The duration that the spell base lingers before dissipating.</li>
            <li>Mana Usage: The amount of mana that the spell base takes to cast, taken from the suit's reserves.</li></ul>

          We were driven to you because of your wavelength. Not everyone has one, but your frequency is precisely what allows you to become a Rider of the Apocalypse. Furthermore, it can evolve to resonate more profoundly with your suit. By pursuing perfect harmony with this new extension of yourself, you thereby grasp transcendence of your eminent being. Obtaining and understanding Herald artifacts will unlock your potential beyond measure. This suit will improve and grow with you. What your wavelength is will give us an idea of how you can both flourish as one.</div>

          <h3>Frame</h3>
          You can start off by building your suit. First, you have to select a frame type. Different frame types have different specialties. Frames have resources and rig slots. Rigs are modifications to the suit itself that adds extra functionality, like upgraded armour systems or improved servosmechanics. Resources are for the attachment of equipment, such as weapons, spells or e-war modules. 
          <h4 style="margin: 15px;">There are two types of resources:</h4>

And yet, legions still poured out from the gate to their crumbling world. If it was going to take a storm to give them pause, then a hurricane we had to become. Rage given form with nothing but a lust for blood that clouded our eyes with a red mist.
          We've grown weak in our respite, but our end will not be subjugation.
          Behold you, a Rider of War.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 20px;">The weapons that your suit can support is determined by its munitions capacity and available weapon hard- points. Conventional weapons are split among four different types: kinetic, explosive, laser and plasma. Each individual weapon has three main components: the style, the calibre or charge, and the ammunition type. </p>

          Ships need a ship Al, so you must choose one that can fit your specific needs. However, all ship Als are more than capable of handling most tasks, and can even auto-pilot your ship for you.

          <h3>Energy Subsystems</h3>
          Your ship needs power, so you must choose at least one energy system.
          You can have up to 2 energy systems and 2 batteries per ship. Total energy output doesn't have to equal its ship's energy use requirements (you would use battery charge). If you buy two of the same type, the second one is 50% off.
          <ul>
            <li>1 unit of energy output = 1 MW  (n<sup>n</sup> thereafter)</li>
            <li>1 unit of battery capacity = 1 TWh (e<sup>n</sup> thereafter)</li>
            <li>1 unit of energy usage = 1 GWh (2<sup>n</sup> thereafter)</li>

          Shield defence is equal to equivalent hull armour ratings. While hull armour can potentially be more protective, shields only need recharging as opposed to repairing. To regenerate 1 shield unit, you need 1 unit of battery charge. You may only pick 1 shield system per ship. </div>
