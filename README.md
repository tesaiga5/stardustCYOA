An unofficial expansion to Stardust CYOA

I was obsessed with Stardust CYOA by stardustAnon, so I decided to make an interactive CYOA. 
I combined the original Stardust CYOA with Stardust Apocalypse by stardustAnon, Stardust Powercreep by Bobgrue, and Stardust Soldier of the Stars. Then, I changed a few details and added a few tweaks/interpretations, thus I called it Stardust Reloaded.

Please let me know of any bugs, if I miss an image credit, or any input/criticism. Apologies in advance for my noob JS. Most images are from Artstation, if it isnt specified where its from, its probably from ArtStation. 

Future Update: Contract Section, Drones/Hangar Space system, UI Improvements
