    </div>

        <p>*Requires diplomacy It turns out that both parties responded to an SOS call claiming that the neutral planet
            was under attack. When both fleets arrived at the same time, they immediately blamed each other. That's when

    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2 Rewards: 18m</h4>
        <p>*Requires two hull repair drones You arrive to find hell. What seems to a Blackhawk dreadnought in critical
            disrepair, surrounded by a large fleet in similar condition, faces outwards against the void. It seems they
            need maintenance help.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3 Rewards: 25m</h4>
        <p>*Requires at least 4 T3 weapons A wave of Fire Legion ships with seemingly a dozen battleships among a swarm

        <p>A hooded person hands you a note and disappears before you even get to notice. Nothing is on it but
            coordinates to a system deep in the outer rims. The whole thing slips your mind for awhile, until at one
            point in the future, you find yourself near the area, anyways.</p>

    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2 Rewards: O</h4>
        <p>*Requires advanced combat, a teleport platform, and "Locust" You're led to a very strange looking structure
            jutting out from a planet. Locust seems drawn to it for some reason, and then insists he goes to

    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3 Rewards: 0</h4>
        <p>*Requires "Plague" The interior is rough, but luckily Plague can clear the way pretty easily. You come across
            strange machinery, and you notice how uncomfortable it makes both Plague and Locust. That's when hundreds of
            large, chitinous crea- tures attack.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4 Rewards: 0</h4>
        <p>*Requires "Styx" and "Archangel" As you and the four Riders mow them down, you realize... this isn't an alien
            building, or at least it wasn't. After your near escape, you find that Plague had pulled some- thing out
            from the machinery-a working set of power armour. Looks like it fits.</p>

    <h3>THEATRE OF FIRE</h3>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 1</h4>
        <p>Forty years ago, a great coalition of pirates was formed. Suppressed in the outskirts too long by Blackhawk
            Elite mercenaries, groups of all manner banded together to drive them out in a series of bloody struggles.
            As a result, they tore a hole through Blackhawk-controlled space, parting it in two to make way for the
            inexorable storm.</p>
        <p>The system of Mjölnir was one of the Blackhawk Elite's major staging systems, but it folded to the coalition
            in a matter of weeks. With the help of the influential Luos Syndicate's Core Ring, it was handed over to the
            Fire Legion-a large alliance of bandits which spearheaded the assault. There, they barricaded themselves in
            and then inexplicably severed contact with their former allies. The afterglow of war held its embrace heavy
            on everyone, so nobody thought anything of it.</p>
        <p>Decades passed by, and turmoil in other regions gradually drew away the scrutiny of the frontier power blocs.
            Little did they know that in the ruins of the planets of Mjölnir, an anomalous chaos was festering. What was
            once the Fire Legion became something otherworldly. Elevated, fanatical, and rabid.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the Legion has made an appearance again. Small gangs wandered away from their impregna- ble
            territory, attacking anyone they happened upon indiscriminately. These skirmishes gradually grew in
            frequency and size, until suddenly, all hell broke loose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2</h4>
        <p>Like an army of ancient gods on their chariots descending from the heav- ens, a great fleet emerged from the
            entropic mists. At first it engulfed Blackhawk ship patrols and roaming Red Dagger gangs, but eventually it
            was smashing through fortified blockades and bases. It took the combined efforts of the Blackhawks, Talons
            and Federation Navy to put a stop to the fleet, but not soon after, another Legion armada emerged.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the world saw the effectiveness of the agents of the Apocalypse. The original fireteam,
            consisting of the agents Archangel, Locust, Plague and Styx, assembled among the unified forces. In the
            ensuing Battle of Carceri, they played a pivotal role and turned the tide. But still, today, the Fire Legion
            continues to push forward, seemingly blinded by a delirious fervor with no loss of momentum.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3</h4>
        <p>Around the war table sits a top com- mander from every involved faction. Assets and logistics are constantly
            being juggled and despite their differ- ences (and for some, hatred) of each other, a valiant effort is
            being put together. Differences in doctrines be damned, everyone agrees that a push needs be made to
            Mjölnir. An admiral from the Federation Navy even proposed to start a propaganda campaign for funds.</p>
        <p>However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the projection and flexibility of all available fleets is
            not enough. The Fire Legion has seemingly no limit in their reinforcements, their scope encompasses no
            meaningful pattern, and all attempts at negotiation are met with garbled comms and white noise. It has
            become clear that the Fire Legion are no longer a known force, but instead pawns thralled to an incongruous
            enemy.</p>
        <p>All eyes beseech the Apocalypse program to offer a new element to this war.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4</h4>
        <p>The first Legion fleets encountered were simply scraps of machinery cobbled together from industrial ships
            and hulls salvaged from abandoned mercenary ves- sels. Now, in more recent fleets, ships are emitting
            bizarre energy signatures akin to that of mana, though with a more volatile and unstable wavelength.</p>
        <p>Radio analysis from covert-ops scouts returns disturbing intel. Planets and moons in Mjölnir and her
            surrounding systems have seen a surge in geothermal activity- something concurrently spurs these satellites
            in a manner never before seen to mankind. Bewilderment strikes all experts and theorists at arms, but
            whatever is happening there indicates productivity-an industrialization of planetary resources at the scale
            of a galactic neighborhood. Mjölnir and her sister systems have been turned into factories of war.</p>
        <p>It's only a matter of time before we witness what abominable horrors will flood out from those worlds. Our
            only ambition now is to push back the tide, and we can only hope that even in victory, we won't fold in to
            whatever ungodly mechanisms await our discovery.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>DISPUTE OF REALITIES</h3>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 1</h4>
        <p>With the emergence of hell taking the world by storm, enemies outside the focus of battle have been
            flittering to and fro. Puppets that they are, the people who were once the Fire Legion are not the only ones
            among their ranks. There is no longer any doubt that this is all the work of a pernicious, exotic force.</p>
        <p>K26L-P is a remote system just outside of Fire Legion-controlled space, and is just out of the way of the
            Blackhawk Elite's sovereignty at the region of Valhalla. Here, Dustkeeper explorers alongside agents working
            with the Gazers have discovered an anomaly on the moon of K26L-P IX, dubbed the "Scorched Cliffs" due to the
            violent storms that can form in the atmosphere. Temporary bases have been set up, and recent events have
            sparked top-level interest from all of the major power blocs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2</h4>
        <p>Jutting out from a tall mountain is a monolithic structure that leads down into the moon. Geological analysis
            returns the possibility that it goes down to the very core, and the surrounding rock formations suggests
            that the moon may have formed around it. This abnormality baffles Dustkeeper scientists, since that would
            imply that the structure precedes any known Herald artifact by billions of years.</p>
        <p>The monolith was not undefended when the Dustkeepers arrived. What appeared to be automatons wielding
            mana-like weaponry were assembled around the Scorched Cliffs, patrolling. They were dealt with after heavy
            losses and reinforcements, but the absurd similarty between their corps- es implies mass production, perhaps
            even some form of duplication. They were tough with almost impenetrable shields, and yet it's reasonable to
            believe that these were less than footsoldiers among their ranks. Sightings and video recordings of the
            skirmishes conclude another issue, however. Among the automatons were several other animated beings clad in
            different look- ing armour.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3</h4>
        <p>When the Gazers arrived, they confirmed the sightings with tales of the existence of an extraordinary race of
            beings. Given the shady history of the Gazers, others can only choose to believe their stories.</p>
        <p>They are the Harbingers. They are the hands which moves the invasion, and their goal is the unmitigated
            extermi- nation of their enemies.</p>
        <p>The Gazers released a manifesto containing documents and logs from a time long past, detailing an exalted
            alien race who con from a different plane. They wield unusual and unorthadox technology, and are thereby
            masters of mana.</p>
        <p>The documents depict that the Harbingers are divided up into clans, each with different beliefs and
            practices. And each clan aligns themselves to one of two alliances-one alliance with an aspect for the
            divine, and the other with an aspect over the cosmos. They are not on friendly terms with each other, but
            something was profound enough to unify them towards a single cause-an invasion of our world.</p>
        <p>It is unknown why the moon was so lightly defended, but with the Scorched Cliffs now occupied by allied
            forces, it's only a matter of time before an assault force is sent to take it back. Even with a Blackhawk
            Elite blockade and reinforcements on the way, the monolith must be defended at all costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4</h4>
        <p>Deep down beneath the monolith is a facility that houses a spatial anomaly-a wormhole contained by an
            accretion disk of mana. We know that this is what the Harbingers came to the moon for, but to where it leads
            is not initially apparent. Probes sent in either don't return results or don't return at all. Gazer squads
            have supposedly gone in without notice of others, but several Apocalypse fireteams have volunteered to enter
            as well.</p>
        <p>The Alliance of the Divine is the one you must be wary of. They hold power over the Alliance of the Cosmos
            who are little more than subjects in their council. An old conflict between the two had sparked but was
            brief, and was decisevly ended with the slaughtering of many of their own.</p>
        <p>I theorize that the other side of this wormhole is where that conflict took place. In other words, it is a
            portal to their own world, one similar to the one which the Fire Legion may have discovered on Mjölnir.
            There is no doubt that the Harbingers on the other side will meet you with violent accord, but if we're to
            turn the tide of this war, we can start with a foothold in their home.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE CULT OF ALD</h3>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 1</h4>
        <p>Far into the edges of the frontier lies the last vestiges of lawlessness. Some deem it a realm for savages,
            seen only in the light of civillization during the rare times a stray Blackhawk patrol wanders past. But
            others call it the last bastion for liberty and freedom, and the Red Dagger Pirates call it home.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the war against the Luos Syndicate, mass disarray has led the powers that be to find a lull in
            their aggressive strategies as they retreated to reor- ganize. Thus, many pirate crews found themselves a
            world aplenty with salvage and bounty, but some saw the calm as a bad omen. Star sailors have their
            superstitions, but none are more proficient at it than a pirate.</p>
        <p>Whispers of dark arts at work spread through the Red Dagger alliance like wildfire. Prominent Dagger veterans
            who recently scoured the edges of the map speak of robed heretics and strange beasts that hide there.
            Grainy, unfamiliar recordings have been passed around only between the most trusted and seasoned captains.
            In a desert warped with crags and sand, temples stood with spires that scraped the heavens. From a tomb
            bathed in cerulean light, a thousand eyes dazzled like a bed of stars. And in a place describable only as
            the darkest corridor of time, a great shadow with ivory choirs for teeth sung into the abyss.</p>
        <p>For the third time in recent memory, a pirate council was called, and all the free people of the Red Daggers
            gathered for their greatest foe yet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2</h4>
        <p>The Cult of Ald has been a thorn in the side of many different groups for many long decades, but neither did
            their cryptic messages or savage symbolism give light to their purpose. Human experimentation is a popular
            conclusion to the Cult's exploits, and inexplainable encounters with the few cultists found stranded in
            civiliza- tion only helped highlight the unnatu- rality of their body movements.</p>
        <p>It was as though they were human no more. They moved in ways no human beings could ever without augmentation,
            and some claim that they could even jump up to tall buildings. Yet, no electronic emissions or digital
            signatures have ever been detectable or traceable among them. Forboding yet is the increase in their
            activity in recent years. With the incursion of the Fire Legion escalating to horrific meas- ures, the Cult
            of Ald appears to be stirring in its wake. Captured images of cultist groups roaming planets where nobody
            should be have been among the surveillance logs distributed around the Red Daggers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3</h4>
        <p>Talon spies working closely with Red Daggers bear intel of the sightings of several temple-like structures,
            seem- ingly appearing on random planets without ever being detected before. Analytics of intel data
            recovered suggests that the Cult's movements surround these temples as though they are an epicenter. Some
            pirate crews have even been attacked by broadsides that seemed to come out of nowhere when sailing through
            these areas, and before a culprit could ever be detected, the threat vanishes into thin air.</p>
        <p>Seven temples have been found thus far, but the scouts are confident that there are more of them out there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4</h4>
        <p>The Cult of Ald... named as such after the constellation of Ald's Crown-a distant region of space explored
            decades ago by deep space explorers from Pulsar Inc. It's a place plentiful with Herald technology.
            Extensive abandoned structures orbit moons, and fleets of Herald ships lie dormant in hangars spanning
            several planets. That expedition is listed as a catastrophic failure in official logs, for they were never
            heard from again. But indeed, they have returned as the foes you fight now.</p>
        <p>old stories tell of an order of knights dedicated to the fight against the paranormal, ages past. They hunted
            tyrant gods with weapons of sapphire, blue as the sea and deep as the abyss. But as they fought to cleanse
            the world from evil, they perished by their own weapons. One by one, their souls were consumed and replaced
            by the essence of the very things they sought to annihilate.</p>
        <p>Through all that I've witnessed in this vast universe, there are few things that still make me tremble. The
            Cult has harnessed the power of mana in ways I could not dare to fathom, and perhaps there are secrets that
            the Heralds uncovered which lead them to their doom.</p>

        <p>*Requires a composition analysis bay A survey of an asteroid belt in the outskirts returns strange readings
            of a metal ore. The composition suggests it would be valuable but the buyer is nowhere to be found.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2 Rewards: 12m</h4>
        <p>*Requires 6 mining harvesters More and more readings come in, and they're all coming from even more
            profitable minerals. The minerals are uncommon but they're not a composition of known materials. The mining

        <h4>Tier 3 Rewards: 26m</h4>
        <p>*Requires 2 composition analysis bays, 4 mining harvesters with mk 3 lasers, and a third cargo bay. A more
            extensive survey reveals a nearby wormhole is forming. It will take advanced harvesting drones to reach into
            the wormhole and refine it to its final state before processing into refined titanium.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4 Rewards: 42m</h4>
        <p>*Must fight 2 Red Dagger dreadnoughts and a salvage harvester. Some powerful Red Dagger dreadnoughts appear,
            having caught word of the lucrative asteroid belt and are looking to claim it. The wormhole closes upon
            their arrival. They are sending waves of salvage harvesters to steal the refined ore. You need to defend
            your precious cargo.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Harrowing</h3>
    <div class="choice">

    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 2 Rewards: 16m</h4>
        <p>*Requires an efficiency module After reaching the coordinates, you find what remains of a Federation fleet.
            The ships are disfigured and corrupted beyond repair. They emit a terrifying, otherworldly energy signature.
            This could be a new species of hostile lifeforms. The energy signature is a mana-like weapon, and they are
            using it on the fleet to tear them apart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 3 Rewards: 28m</h4>
        <p>*Requires a Phase Cannon, four tech overcharges, or four ion cannons
            There are more of them... a small fleet of them has appeared. With a Phase Cannon or four Ion Cannons, your
            ship is powerful enough to handle a small fleet of these enemies. They will target your weakest point. This
            is a very volatile and unpredictable group of enemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 4 Rewards: 50m</h4>
        <p>*Requires a standard boarding party and 2 more anti-matter cannons
            The main ship, a dreadnought, is cloaked. The only way to stop it is to use a boarding party. With enough
            crew members, you can get through their shields and destroy their core. If you don't have enough crew
            members, you'll need two more anti-matter cannons to destroy it from the outside. You must stop it before it
            reaches the nearest inhabited planet.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Hanged Man</h3>
    <div class="choice">
        <h4>Tier 1 Rewards: 4m</h4>
        <p>A man, who looks as if he has been through hell, approaches you. He asks for a moment of your time. He has an

        <p>*Requires a second Gazer agent with a high level of security clearance and a high-powered stealth module. The
            base is not a base, it's a trap. A powerful mercenary group has been tracking the Gazer agent and you.
            You've been led to a trap. Now you need to escape the trap and report the mercenary group to the Federation
            Navy.</p>
